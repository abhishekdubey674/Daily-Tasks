 16-07-2025 :- Today I have studied about JavaScript

What is JavaScript –
JavaScript is a programming language that helps make websites interactive. It can be used to add things like buttons, animations, sliders, forms, and more.

Where is JavaScript used –
JavaScript is mainly used in web development. It runs inside the browser and allows us to build dynamic web pages. It is used with HTML and CSS.

Basic Concepts I studied:

Variables – Used to store data. Example:
let name = "John";

Data Types – Different types of values in JavaScript:
- String: "Hello"
- Number: 25
- Boolean: true or false

Functions – A block of code used to perform a task.
Example:
function greet() {
   console.log("Hello!");
}

If-Else – Used for decision making.
Example:
if (age > 18) {
   console.log("You are an adult");
} else {
   console.log("You are a minor");
}

Loops – Used to repeat code multiple times.
Example:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   console.log(i);
}

Arrays – A list of items.
Example:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

Objects – Used to store data in key-value pairs.
Example:
let person = {
   name: "Ali",
   age: 22
};

JavaScript helps make websites smarter and user-friendly.


 17-07-2025:- Senior developers may seem like magicians, but their skills come from years of experience, learning from mistakes, and deep knowledge of tools and patterns. What appears effortless is actually built on persistence, memory, and a willingness to fail and improve. Their instincts often come from past hard lessons, not just talent. With time and dedication, any developer can reach that level — it’s not magic, it’s mastery.

23-07-2025 :- today i have read an article " What We Mean When We Say “Software Engineer”"- Doug Durham talks about how the title "software engineer" is often misused, which leads to misunderstanding in the software field. He explains the difference between roles like developer, software engineer, senior engineer, and architect — each having unique duties and skill levels. Developers mainly write code, while engineers focus on structure, design, and teamwork. Senior engineers help guide others and handle complex problems, and architects plan the system's overall structure. Doug stresses the need for proper training and clear role definitions to handle future tech challenges and avoid confusion or mistakes in projects.
